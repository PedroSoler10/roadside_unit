CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindVPI.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "VPI", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "VPI" (requested
  version 2.0) with any of the following names:

    VPIConfig.cmake
    vpi-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "VPI" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "VPI_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "VPI" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
